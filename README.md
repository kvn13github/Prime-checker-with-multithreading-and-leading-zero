# Prime-checker-with-multithreading-and-leading-zero
I started with the Python code, then added multithreading in V2, then translated it to Java and C++(11), the C code I have also compiled to a Linux binary.

Check the output examples on how to use it in a terminal.

So the code first asks how many digits, then prints the highest prime, then the lower primes, with a leading zero (imagine a bike lock with numbers)
then checks these for Sophie-germain and safe primes.

With the added multithreading it is capable of generating output very fast even for prime numbers several digits long.

Created with the use of ChatGTP.
